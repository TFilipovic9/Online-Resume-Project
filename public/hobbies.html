  I’ve been playing football since the age of five, and it has been a big part
  of my life ever since. Currently, I play senior-level football in the First
  County League. In addition to playing, I also work as a coach for youth age
  groups.

  I started playing video games when I was a kid — first on the PlayStation 1,
  and later more on the PlayStation 4. Nowadays, I play games on my PC in my
  free time. I especially enjoy competitive games like Fortnite and Rocket
  League.
