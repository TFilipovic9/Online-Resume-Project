    <h2>Sumary</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Theo Filipović, and I'm currently a Computer Engineering
      student at FERIT Osijek, specializing in hardware-software systems and
      development. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by computers,
      video games, and technology in general — which naturally led me to pursue
      a career in the world of software development.
